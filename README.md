## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (or yarn).
- You have a basic understanding of React and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-management-app.git
   cd book-management-app

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

   # or

   yarn install

3. Start the development server:

   npm start

   # or

   yarn start

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1. npm start or yarn start

   Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. npm test or yarn test

   Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

   npm run build or yarn build

   Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

3. npm run eject

   Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
